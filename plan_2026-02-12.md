# Steinberger Deep Plan — Nanochat Repo (2026-02-12)

## Scope
- Focus: simplification and architecture coherence after shared-training refactor.
- Files in review: `src/main.rs`, `src/lib.rs`, `src/config.rs`, `src/cli.rs`, `src/experiments/mod.rs`, `src/scalar/mod.rs`, `src/scalar/bigram.rs`, `src/scalar/minigpt.rs`, `src/tensor/mod.rs`, `src/training.rs`.

## File-by-file checks

1. `src/main.rs`
- Validate dispatch ergonomics are now mode-agnostic and avoid error-string conversion at call sites.
- Keep run-or-exit path simple and explicit.

2. `src/lib.rs`
- Confirm module exposure remains minimal and order remains stable.
- No further refactor needed unless we want to hide internal modules behind feature gates.

3. `src/config.rs`
- Keep configuration enums/types stable; only verify derived traits and Display impl completeness for new errors/paths.
- No logic coupling candidates identified.

4. `src/cli.rs`
- Ensure CLI defaults centralize shared config constants through `training::DEFAULT_CHECKPOINT_DIR`.
- Verify parsing surface still matches `Config` usage and test coverage for mini-gpt plus tensor/invalid combos.

5. `src/experiments/mod.rs`
- Keep scalar-only design deliberate.
- Confirm file paths and artifact dir creation are stable after default path move.

6. `src/scalar/mod.rs`
- Central review of mode dispatch (bigram/minigpt), eval/warmdown cadence source, and split helpers delegate cleanly.
- Confirm no duplicated constants remain for corpus/decay logic.

7. `src/scalar/bigram.rs`
- Confirm sampling and transition helpers are fully delegated to `training` and only keep model-specific math.
- Keep Value-graph semantics isolated to bigram-only behavior.

8. `src/scalar/minigpt.rs`
- Confirm duplicated logic moved to `training` where common.
- Verify no residual local `weighted_choice`/pair-split code remains.

9. `src/training.rs` (new)
- Treat as canonical shared layer for corpus styling, sampling helpers, splits, LR schedule.
- Ensure public surface doesn’t accidentally overfit to scalar/tensor internals.

10. `src/tensor/mod.rs`
- Primary simplification payoff: common split/sampling constants and helpers moved to `training`.
- Validate tensor-specific preconditions are explicit (`UnsupportedModelKind`, `UnsupportedOptimizer`).
- Add/keep tests for unsupported combinations and compatibility constraints.

## High-ROI rollout order

1) Validation consistency
- Keep support checks (`model kind`, optimizer capabilities) in all tensor entry paths.

2) Test expansion
- Add mode/optimizer rejection tests in tensor test helper paths for compile-time non-tch fallback.
- Keep parity and regression tests focused on outputs and scheduling.

3) Cross-mode simplification audit
- Confirm all duplicated corpus/split/sampling logic is in `training` and only behavior glue remains in modules.

## Recommendations
- Targeted path is stable: no broad architecture refactor is required.
- Evidence: after migration, tensor/scalar now share same split + sampling constants and test surfaces.

## Execution status
- Added consistency checks in tensor internal test helper.
- Added two tests for unsupported tensor config combinations.
- Added CLI-level parse-to-runtime public API rejection coverage for tensor mode (`train`/`sample`) with unsupported combinations.
- Full verification blocked by missing `cargo` in current environment.
